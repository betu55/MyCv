This is a pretty short readme, and it is meant to adress a sollution if there might be any confusion in my git log.

There are 12 commits that were done loally 11 of which are made after our last lab session. But there is one commit
that was done during our lab session and it was on the Gallery.html file.

Thank you for reading, I hope this clears up things a bit.
