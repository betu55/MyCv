                <article>
                    <p>Well it is known that the browsers we use now-a-days have more features and tools within them. </p>
                    <p>But in the early ages all of the web pages that were being developed were perfected using pixele values </p>
                    <p>since there were no fancy features going on in almost all browsers. In this age tho most browsers have a lot </p>
                    <p>of cool features, and one that almos everyone knows is the <strong>ZOOM</strong> feature. So instead of using pixeles to </p>
                    <p>size elements in css it is more relevant to use relative sizing like: %, em, rem instead of pixel values. </p>
                    <p>Users must be able to zoom the viewport without loss of content and functionality, or restrictions imposed by  </p>
                    <p>CSS values or viewport scaling settings. They must be able to resize text without assistive technology up to 200%. </p>
                    <p>It is easy to make our website user friendly by using relative size to change the size of the elements in css.</p>
                    <p>BY now I guess the answer for the question above is clear.</p>

                <article>
                    <p>CSS3 version introduced new features that allowed developers to style HTML elements with less CSS code. At first </p>
                    <p>browsers did not support CSS3 features, and it took a while for them to become fully compatable with CSS3. Oh and </p>
                    <p>by the way CSS3 is backwards-compatible with former CSS versions. It means that css3 features work on web pages </p>
                    <p>using older CSS. The following are overviews of new features in CSS3.</p><br>
                    <p></p>
                    <p><strong>Box Shadow:</strong> Adds a shadow to an element.</p>
                    <p><strong>Opacity:</strong> Makes elements see-through or completely transparent.</p>
                    <p><strong>Attribute Selectors:</strong> instead of ID and Class selectors developers can now select elements via their attributes.</p>
                    <p><Strong>New Colors:</Strong>new colores are added in CSS3, for example RGBA, HSL, HSLA and Gradient Colors</p>
